# Spotify_playlist_collage
 
This code uses the Spotipy API to collate playlist cover images from the input playlists and create a collage of them in a square grid which is then able to be saved as a png file. This function requires a square number of playlists to be inputted, so 1,4,9,16, etc., as a list of string URLs.
